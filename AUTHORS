ls1 mardyn authors
==================

The first predecessor ("Mader program") of the present code was written by Daniel Mader.

The first major revision (called "moldy" or "ls1") of the Mader program was conducted by Martin Bernreuther.

Since the second relaunch, conducted by Martin Buchholz, the program is called "ls1 mardyn" (large systems 1: molecular dynamics).

The list shown below only includes authors who contributed subsequent to the second relaunch, omitting a great number of previous contributors, but including all people who recently modified the source code of ls1 mardyn. Note that contributors who participated on an administrative and management level are also missing from this list, which merely reflects direct access to the code base.
