This paper describes the architecture of a \cuda{} kernel that supports different molecule potential types and explains optimizations and implementation details.
We take a hard look at different approaches for parallelizing molecule interaction calculations and compare them.

It becomes evident that the warp block cell processor is most effective for higher molecule counts per cell and the simplest solution works best for low molecule counts per cell.

There are lots of further optimizations possible and the \cuda{} implementation does not yet support all features of MarDyn like domain decomposition and halo cell handling.
