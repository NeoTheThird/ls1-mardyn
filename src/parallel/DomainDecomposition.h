/*****************************************************
 * This class represents the whole simulation domain *
 * which is divided into n smaller domains. n is the *
 * number of processes involved in the parallel      *
 * execution. The methods perform operations which   *
 * involve more than one domain                      *
 *****************************************************/
//! The domain is the spacial area which can be reached by the molecules
//! during the simulation. At the start of the simulation, the information
//! about position, velocity,... of all molecules is stored in the 
//! phasespace file. The task of this class is to read in all information
//! and distribute it to the processes (or let each process read it's own information)
//! In a domain decomposition, the domain is divided into several parts and each process
//! is assigned one of those subdomains. For one time-step, each process works on this
//! subdomain as if it was the whole domain. The different sub-domains are
//! overlapping a little bit, because at the boundary of a domain, neighbouring molecules
//! are needed for the force calculation. After one time step, there has to be some
//! Communication along the boundary with the processes which work on neighbouring domains.
//!
//! On each process, there is an instance of the class Phasespace which has to hold all
//! information about molecules which are within the process' domain.
//!
//! The phasespace file looks like this:
//! MDProject \n
//! phasespaceSize "x (double)" "y (double)" "z (double)" \n
//! timestepLength "dt (double)" \n
//! currentTime "t (double)" \n
//! cutoffRadius "rc (double)" \n
//! NumberOfMolecules "N (int)" \n
//! [id1] [type1] [x1] [y1] [z1] [vx1] [vy1] [vz1] \n
//! [id2] [type2] [x2] [y2] [z2] [vx2] [vy2] [vz2] \n
//! ... \n
//! [idN] [typeN] [xN] [yN] [zN] [vxN] [vyN] [vzN] \n

//!
//! In a domain decomposition, each process gets part of the spacial domain.
//! In this implementation, the whole domain has to be a cuboid which is
//! decomposed into several smaller cuboids.
//! The main difficulty is that at the boundary, each process needs molecules
//! from neighbouring domains to be able to calculate the forces on the own
//! molecules. Another problem is that molecules are moving across the
//! boundaries of local domains. So methods are implemented to transfer those molecules
//! @todo reference to a paper describing the %domain decomposition
