//! @brief domain decomposition based on a kind of KD-Tree
//! @author Martin Buchholz
//!
//! There are two main goals which shall be achieved by this class.
//! First, it should be able to distribute the load evenly among the
//! processes (so create a load-balanced decomposition). The second goal
//! is to do that in a way so that the domain boundaries are in region
//! which are not dense (e.g. gas). This reduces the number of
//! necessary double computations and the amount of communication.
//!
//! The technique used is a modified KD-Tree. First, the region is discretised
//! into cells (size equals (or larger then) cutoffradius). This region is then
//! divided into two smaller cuboids. Those cuboids are again recursively divided
//! into smaller cuboids. Three questions arise:
//! - in which dimension (x,y,z) is the cube divided in each step ?
//! - where is the "cut" (how many cell-layers on the "left" and on the "right") ?
//! - how many processes share the "left" and the "right" part ?
//! This class tries to find an answer to this three questions which balances the
//! load and and the same time tries to minimize the communication (and double
//! calculation) costs. This is done by "guessing" the overall costs/time for
//! each possible division and selection the best. A guess basically works as follows:
//! for one division, the computation costs for each part are calculated (using
//! e.g. number of particles, number of pairs, some heuristics, ...). For each
//! part, these costs are divide by the number of procs which share this part
//! (here again the best combination is used). Additionally, the costs for the "cut"
//! are calculated (again heuristics e.g. depending on the number of pairs which are cut)
//! With all the calculated costs, one can select that division which is cheapest.
//! This is done recursively until each process has its own region.
//!
//! @todo Development of this class is finished, some correctness tests still have to be done

	//!
	//! The workflow is as follows (some steps only if balancing shall be done):
	//! - if balance: _numParticlesPerCell is updated to be able to calculate the load of the cells
	//! - if balance: A new decomposition tree is calculated (using recDecomp) based on the particle distribution
	//! - if balance: find out neighbours
	//! - collect pointers to particles to be send to all neighbours
	//! - communicate with each neighbour how many particles will be sent and recieved
	//! - copy data to be sent into buffers
	//! - if balance: rebuild the molecule container (new size and region), replace the old decomposition tree
	//! - transfer data and insert the recieved molecules into the moleculeContainer
	//! - for processes which span the whole domain in at least one direction, ensure periodic boundary
