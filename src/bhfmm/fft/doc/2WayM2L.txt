Idea: Tf(r)_i,j = (-1)^(p+1) Tf(-r)_(i+p),j

Definitions
***********

let p be the order of the expansions
let T(r) be the transfer function expansion of vector r with expansion terms T_l,m(r), (0<= l <p, -l <= m <= l)

(0) Then for -r, T_l,m(-r) = (-1)^l T_l,m(r)
See expansions properties and definition


Lemmas

(1) Let x be a vector, F(-x) = - F(x)

Proof: trivial given Fourier transform formula

(2) Let x be a vector of length N (N even), let x' be a vector of length N with x'(i) = (-1)^i x(i).
Let X = F(x) and X'=F(x').
Then X(i) = X'(i+N/2)

Proof:
X'(k) = Sum_n x'(n) e^(-2i Pi k n/N)
      = Sum_n x(n) (-1)^n e^(-2i Pi k n/N)
      = Sum_n x(n) e^(-i Pi n) e^(-2i Pi k n/N)
      = Sum_n x(n) e^(-2i Pi n (k/N + 1/2))
      = Sum_n x(n) e^(-2i Pi n (k+N/2)/N)
      = X(k+N/2)
(and X' and X are N periodic)


Thm
***

Using the standard conversion of T(r) into a Fourier Transformed matrix Tf(r):
Tf(r)_i,j = (-1)^(p+1) Tf(-r)_(i+p),j

Proof:
The matrix form TM(r) of T(r) prior to the Fourier transform verify
TM(r)_i,j = (-1)^i (-1)^(p+1) TM(-r)_i,j
The (-1)^i comes from (0), the (-1)^(p+1) comes from the fact that the expansions are written upside down
so the line of order p is the first one and will be minus the other one if p is even, equal if p is odd
The FT is perform on the line first, using (1) the symmetry stay, then on the column so using (2) we have our result
