!!Contains efficient datastructures

Currently, only one type of datastructure is used: A Particle Container.
The task of a ParticleContainer is to store Particles and provide access to them
and especially efficient access to neighbouring pairs of particles.
The class ParticleContainer is an interface providing methods for these tasks.
All other datastructures have to implement that interface.
