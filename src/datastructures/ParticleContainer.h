//! @brief This Interface is used to get access to particles and pairs of particles
//! 
//! A particleContainer is used to store Particles with a short-range potential
//! in a way that the access to pairs of neighbouring particles is efficient.
//! Neighbouring particles are particles which have a distance shorter than
//! a given cutoff radius. 
//! A common task when using a PariticleContainer is to do do something for
//! all paritcles. This can be done using the methods begin, next and end, e.g.:
//! \code
//! ParticleContainer* partContPtr; 
//! ParticleType* partPtr; 
//! for(partPtr = partContPtr->begin(); partPtr != partContPtr->end(); partPtr = partContPtr->next()){ 
//!   partPtr->doSomething(); 
//! } 
//! \endcode
//!
//! Particles stored in this container can either belong to the local process
//! or they can be duplicates (from neighbouring processes or periodic boundary)
//! To distinguish them, a bounding box is defined through two opposing corners
//! (_boundingBoxMin[3] and _boundingBoxMax[3]. Particles inside this bounding
//! box belong to this process, those outside shouldn't. An exception to this is
//! when particles are moved in a time step. Is has to be ensured, that particles
//! which leave the bounding box are properly handled.
//! 
//! This interface doesn't implement the datastructure, it just tells which
//! methods a class implementing this kind of datastructure has to provide to 
//! be used by the framework. Such a class should
//! be implemented as a subclass of this class.

    //! It is important, that the Particle is entered in "the front" of the container.
    //! This is important when the container is traversed with the "next" method.
    //! E.g. a method traversing the container which adds copies of particles 
    //! (periodic boundary) must not run over the added copies.

    //! This method has to be implemented in derived classes
    //! Precondition: All Particles of the process + halo molecules are stored
    //! Task: Run over all pairs (Each pair exactely once!) of particles (within cutoffradius)
    //! Important: Some pairs might be "duplicated": All pairs which cross the boundary occur twice 
    //! (second time at the periodic image). Those pairs are from the point of view of the datastructure
    //! two different pairs, but they both times connect the same particles.
    //! For a pair which occurs twice, it has to be made sure, that one gets the status "original pair"
    //! and the other one "duplicated pair". 
    //! For each pair found, there is an action executed, but it is a different action for
