!Unit Tests

Each class (and each method in the class) should be tested for correctness. 
One way to do this are Unit-Tests. So for each class in the project, there should be 
a Unit Test. Thats why the structure in this directory should reflect the structure of
the whole source code. So there should e.g. be a subfolder of this folder called datastructures
where all UnitTests for the classes from the datastructures namespace are placed.
