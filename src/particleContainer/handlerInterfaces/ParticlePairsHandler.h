//! @brief interface for defining the action performed when processing a pair
//! @author Martin Buchholz
//! 
//! The idea of a ParticleContainer is, that the container itself only knows
//! about how to efficiently store and access Particles (or neighbouring pairs
//! of Particles) It doesn't know anything (exception follows) about the 
//! internal structure of a Particle, or what action should be performed for 
//! a pair of particles (an action could e.g. be to calculate the force).
//! The only thing that has to be known from a particle is it's position.
//! 
//! An application e.g. wants to find all neighbouring particle pairs and
//! calculate the forces between them. The retrieval of the pairs has to be
//! done by the ParticleContainer, but the force calculation has to be
//! performed somewhere else. That's where this interface comes into play.
//! There are typically three things to be done:
//! - Do some initial stuff before the pair processing
//! - Do something for each pair
//! - Do something after all pairs have been processed
//!
//! The ParticleContainer has an instance of a class implementing this interface
//! as a member variable. When the method of the ParticleContainer that traverses
//! the pairs is called, it first has to call the method "init()" of it's
//! ParticlePairsHandler, then for each pair "processPair(...)" and at the end
//! "finish()".
//! A class implementing this interface now serves as an adapter between the
//! particleContainer an some other part of the programm (e.g. force calculation)
