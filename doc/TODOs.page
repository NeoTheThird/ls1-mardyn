/** \page "TODOs and Open Issues"

This page should collect open points, concerning design or (non-)functionality 
of the code.

There are plenty of TODOs or FIXMEs in the code, which partly refer to individual 
persons. Let's place here things which we could use as a basis for Coders' Day or so.

|| Issue    || Description
|  pm files | pm files define mass for dipoles and quadrupoles, which are not 
              supported within Mardyn
|  cutoff radius | a lj cutoff is included in the component definition, but not used
                   (both in the phasespace file and in the component class)
| ASCII-Reader   | Not used - but still necessary???
